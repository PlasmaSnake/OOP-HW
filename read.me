1   A big difference Static variables or Class variables is that a change made to one
 particular instance of the class will change all of the other
 instance with the same variable. Class variables can be accessed
  without creating an instance.


2 & 3	It makes sense why one would write a getters and setters methods
 for a public class but they should not. Private classes are better because
 they provide encapsulation. There's is only once access point to modify for getters
 and setters. Lastly they provide better control over the data.

4. B is a superclass or the parent and class A is the child.

5.It means that a subclass can take the pre existing methods from a super and use
  them as its own. DRY.

6.The programmer could use upcasting to go to the super. From the super a method could
  be declared allowing variables with similar properties to be altered. It is related to
  Inheritance.

7. A concrete class need the implementation of all of its methods, but it can still be over
        Written. An abstract class needs all methods implemented, however you can make that subclass
        Abstract not instantiate the class from the start.

8. A class using implements must use all methods that were declared in the interface.
 The values and names need to be the same as well. Based on my research you can and cannot
  declare methods in the interface so i'm not positive.

9.
   abstract class ChicFila{
        abstract int getNumOfSandwiches();
        }

        class Popeyes extends ChicFila{
        int getNumOfSandwiches(){return 7;}
                }

        class KFC extends ChicFila{
        int getNumOfSandwiches(){return 3;}
            }

	    class TestFila{
        public static void main(String args[]){
         ChicFila a;
         a = new Popeyes();

            System.out.println("You only sold: "+a.getNumOfSwndeiches()+" %");
            a=new KFC();

            System.out.println("You only sold: "+a.getNumOfSandwiches()+" %");
                    }}

           An abstract class needs to be extended while a final class cant be extended.

 10.    Overriding a method is when a subclass has the same values as the super
 such as name or parameters as its super. If the parent class has an
 object used to call the method then it will inherit the parents properties.
 However, is the child class is used to invoke the method then it would get the
 childâ€™s properties.

11.     Linked list is memory from the RAM that is linked together allowing the user to add inputs.
In an array list the memory is decided and if changes needed to occur the RAM would have to find a new space
to store all the memories together.List is an interface whereas Linked list or array list are
classes. Lastly arrayLists are subtypes to the List which means that the methods are called form
the super type but executed from the subtype. This is polymorphism.
